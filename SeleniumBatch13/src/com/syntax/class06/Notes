Selenium 06

Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alerts take a complete focus of our main page that we are on.
We cannot proceed further until is is handled.

3 types of Alerts:
1. Web Based alerts/ HTML Alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2. Javascript alert/ browser alert - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                     we cannot inspect it
3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium - not windows OS, it is a window window

Types of JS alerts:
1. Simple alert - click ok
2. Confirmation alert - either cancel or ok
3. prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click on cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()


Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple vies on one page

3 ways to interact or to switch to a frame
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by webelement

in alerts - switch to an alert manually and switch back automatically
in frames - switch to frame manually and switch back to the main page manually
